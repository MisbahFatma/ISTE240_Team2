**Overview:**  
This assignment marks the first milestone in the development of the MindEase project. The goal is to demonstrate an understanding of Java Spring Boot fundamentals by creating a backend application scaffold with essential model classes (beans) and serving a static landing page.  

**Objectives:**  
- Set up a Spring Boot project using IntelliJ with the Spring Web dependency.  
- Implement core model classes (`Student`, `StressSurvey`, `Resource`, `Counsellor`, `Booking`) with appropriate attributes and getters/setters.  
- Serve a static landing page (`index.html`) that introduces the project and provides navigation to the main functionalities.  
- Use GitHub for version control, ensuring proper commits, pushes, and collaborative workflow among team members.  

**Expected Deliverables:**  
1. A functional Spring Boot scaffold project.  
2. Five model classes implemented as Spring components with appropriate attributes.  
3. A static landing page accessible at the root URL, reflecting project purpose and features.  
4. A properly formatted README with team member information and project description.  
5. Demonstrated use of Git/GitHub for collaborative code management.  

**Learning Outcomes:**  
- Understand Spring Boot project setup and Maven configuration.  
- Apply object-oriented principles in defining model classes.  
- Integrate static web content with backend services.  
- Practice professional Git workflows and collaborative development.
